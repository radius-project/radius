## Prompt Contents

Modify Radius to support **two modes of operation**, taking inspiration from Terraform and Terraform Cloud:

1. **Control Plane Radius** – the existing centralized Radius control plane.
2. **Repo Radius** – a decentralized mode of Radius that runs as a command-line tool and stores its state in a Git repository.

This specification focuses exclusively on **Repo Radius**.

---

## Repo Radius Overview

Repo Radius is a lightweight, Git-centric mode of Radius designed to run without a centralized control plane. It treats a Git repository as the system of record and is optimized for CI/CD workflows, particularly GitHub Actions.

---

## Execution Model

Repo Radius should:

- Run as a executable on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Be installable via native package managers:
  - WinGet (Windows)
  - Homebrew (macOS)
  - `apt` and `dnf` (Linux)
- Be optimized for non-interactive execution in a GitHub Action.
- Expose a command surface similar to the existing `rad` CLI.

---

## Configuration Model (input files to Radius)

All Repo Radius configuration is stored in the Git repository.

- **Resource Types**
  - Stored in `radius/config/types`
  - Multiple Resource Types stored as YAML files (same as Radius Resource Types today without modification).
- **Environments**
  - Stored in `radius/config`
  - Stored as `.env` files.
  - Default environment is stored in the `.env` file
  - Other environments are stored in `.env.<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>`
  - May include:
    - AWS account and region
    - Azure subscription and resource group
    - Kubernetes cluster API endpoint and namespace
    - An alternative `recipes.yaml` manifest file
    - Terraform CLI configuration (`terraformrc`)
  - `.env` files must **not** contain credentials.
- **Recipes**
  - Stored as a YAML file in the `radius/config` directory.

## CLI Commands

### `rad init`

1. Verifies the current working directory is a Git repository.
1. Creates the following directory structure:
   - `.radius/`
     - `config/` – Contains Radius configuration files
     - `model/` - Contains the application model (created by a separate project).
     - `plan/` - Contains deployment scripts generated by `rad plan`.
     - `deploy/` - Contains resource details captured by `rad deploy`.
     - 'graph/' - Containers Mermaid diagrams which visualize the Radius Graph

1. Creates Resource Types in the `radius/config/types` directory from the Radius resource-types-contrib repository
1. Searches the repo for existing `.env` files. If exists, confirms that each `.env` file contains one of:
   - AWS account and region
   - Azure subscription and resource group
   - Kubernetes context name and namespace
   - If a `.env` file does not exist or is insufficient, prompt the user:
     - "Which cloud platform should Radius deploy to? 1. Local only 2. AWS 3. Azure 4. Kubernetes only
     - Dependent upon the response, prompt the user for the `.env` file contents. If AWS or Azure also get Kubernetes details

1. Interactively prompts the user:
   - "When orchestrating application deployments, what deployment tool should Radius use? (T)erraform, (B)icep
   - Create a default `recipes.yaml` in `radius/config/` based on user input

---

### `rad plan`

1. Generates **ready-to-execute deployment scripts** (bash or PowerShell).
   - Scripts are derived from the recipe manifest specified in `.env`.
   - Scripts are not intended to be modified by the user, but is captured for auditability and to be part of the application graph (a separate project)
   - Initially supported deployment engines:
     - Terraform (plan/apply)
     - Bicep
   - Future deployment engines may include:
     - Helm
     - CloudFormation
     - Crossplane
     - Ansible
   - For example TODO TODO

1. Output a Mermaid diagram as a visualization of the application graph including the application model and the physical resources which will be created or modified.
1. If the deployment engine is Terraform, Radius execute `terrafor plan` and store output in the `radius/plan` directory.

---

### `rad deploy`

1. Radius validated that environment variables are set for the target platform (AWS_ACCOUNT_ID, AWS_REGION, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, and AZURE_TENANT_ID)
1. Radius orchestrates the application deployment by executing the deployment scripts **only from a Git commit hash or tag**.
   - Deploying directly from uncommitted local files is not supported.
1. After deployment, Radius captures structured details about the deployed resources in the Git repository, including:
   - The Environment used
   - Cloud platform resource IDs for each deployed resource
   - The full set of properties for each deployed resource as returned by the cloud platform
1. Update the Mermaid diagram with the physical resources which were created or modified.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Repo Radius:

- Does **not** have a concept of Radius Resource Groups.
- Does **not** have a formal Environment object beyond the simple `.env.<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>` files.
- Does **not** have a Terraform Settings objects because the Radius relies upon the user's existing Terraform configuration in their execution environment.
- Does **not** have a Credentials or Bicep Settings objects because the Radius uses the existing authentication to an OCI registry in the user's execution environment.

---

## Open Questions

Provide guidance on the following outstanding questions:

1. What features or behaviors would make Repo Radius particularly well-suited for GitHub Actions?
1. What file format should be used to store deployed resource details?
1. Does Radius need a state store for AWS resources to maintain idempotency? We believe the answer is no if only Terraform is used to deploy to AWS, but may be yes if Bicep is supported.

## Future Enhancements

1. Adapts to existing deployment scripts
   - Examines the Git repository for existing IaC code (*.tf, *.bicep, chart.yaml, kustomize.yaml, template.yaml) and ad

1. Adapts to existing GitOps configurations
