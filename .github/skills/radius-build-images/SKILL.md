# Radius: Build and Push Container Images

Build Radius service images from source and push them to a container registry that your Kubernetes cluster can reach. This follows the workflow documented in `docs/contributing/contributing-code/contributing-code-building/README.md` and `docs/contributing/contributing-code/contributing-code-control-plane/generating-and-installing-custom-build.md`.

## Images

The following images are built from this repository:

| Image             | Source                          |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `ucpd`            | `deploy/images/ucpd`            |
| `applications-rp` | `deploy/images/applications-rp` |
| `dynamic-rp`      | `deploy/images/dynamic-rp`      |
| `controller`      | `deploy/images/controller`      |
| `bicep`           | `deploy/images/bicep`           |
| `pre-upgrade`     | `deploy/images/pre-upgrade`     |
| `testrp`          | `test/testrp`                   |
| `magpiego`        | `test/magpiego`                 |

> **Not built here:** The `deployment-engine` and `dashboard` images are **not** built from this repository. They are published separately to `ghcr.io/radius-project/`. When installing with a custom registry you need to pin these to their public location — see the `radius-install-custom` skill.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Check that the required tools are available:

1. **Docker**: Run `docker info` — confirm the Docker daemon is running.
2. **Make**: Run `make --version` — confirm GNU Make is installed.
3. **Go**: Run `go version` — the required version is in `go.mod`.

If any prerequisite is missing, stop and report which tool needs to be installed.

### Step 2: Set the Registry

Ask the user for their container registry if `DOCKER_REGISTRY` is not already set. The registry must be one the user can push to and their Kubernetes cluster can pull from.

```sh
export DOCKER_REGISTRY=ghcr.io/<your-registry>
export DOCKER_TAG_VERSION=latest
```

> **Note:** The user must already be logged in to the registry (`docker login`, `az acr login`, etc.). If you get authentication errors, ask the user to log in first.
>
> **Default:** If `DOCKER_REGISTRY` is not set, the Makefile defaults to your OS username (from `build/docker.mk`). Always set it explicitly.

### Step 3: Build and Push the Images

Build all images and push them to the registry in one command:

```sh
DOCKER_REGISTRY=${DOCKER_REGISTRY} DOCKER_TAG_VERSION=${DOCKER_TAG_VERSION} make docker-build docker-push
```

This compiles all Go binaries, builds each Docker image, and pushes them to the registry. The `copy-manifests` step runs automatically.

To build and push a **single image** (useful for fast iteration):

```sh
make docker-build-<image-name> && make docker-push-<image-name>
# e.g. make docker-build-applications-rp && make docker-push-applications-rp
```

### Step 4: Verify

Confirm the images were pushed:

```sh
docker images --filter "reference=${DOCKER_REGISTRY}/*:${DOCKER_TAG_VERSION}"
```

Then proceed to the `radius-install-custom` skill to install Radius on your cluster.

## Private Registries

For private registries that require authentication to pull, you will need to create a Kubernetes image pull secret when installing. See the `radius-install-custom` skill for details.

## Multi-Architecture Builds

For native `linux/arm64` images (e.g. on Apple Silicon with an arm64 Kubernetes cluster), first set up buildx (one-time):

```sh
make configure-buildx
```

Select the builder and build the canonical core snapshot:

```sh
docker buildx use radius-builder
export GORELEASER_IMAGE_REGISTRY="${DOCKER_REGISTRY}"
make install-goreleaser install-syft install-jq install-yq install-oras
make goreleaser-check goreleaser-snapshot
make goreleaser-push-edge
make docker-publish-bicep DOCKER_TAG_VERSION=edge
```

This publishes the five core images and Bicep as `edge` in the selected registry. Install with that tag. Snapshot mode itself only loads platform-specific local images; the edge target assembles their registry manifests without recompiling. Functional workflows own `testrp` and `magpiego` publication with test-specific tags; retain the single-image Make targets for local testing.
