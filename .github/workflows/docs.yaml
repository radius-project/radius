            You are editing files which require a docs update. Please ensure you've made the appropriate changes to the docs and submitted a PR.
            - Swagger changes require reference edge docs to be updated [here](https://github.com/radius-project/docs/tree/edge/docs/content/reference/resource-schema)
            - Make sure to create a branch and submit a PR into the edge branch instead of the default latest branch, as the swagger changes will not be available until the next release.
