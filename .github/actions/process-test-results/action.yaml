name: "Process Test Results"
description: |
  Processes a batch of test results including creating a github artifact and annotating the Pull Request (if applicable).

  This requires using 'gotestum' to run tests, which our makefile can do automatically. Install 'gotestsum' using:

    go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@v1.10.0

  You will also need to set the path for the results file using an environment variable. This would output the jUnit
  test results format which is what we require.
    
    GOTESTSUM_OPTS: '--junitfile ./dist/unit_test_results_raw.xml'
  
  Then running 'make <test target>' will do the right thing :)

inputs:
  test_group_name:
    description: 'Name to use for reporting (eg: Unit Tests)'
    required: true
  artifact_name:
    description: 'Name to use for uploading artifacts (eg: unit_test_results)'
    required: true
  result_directory:
    description: 'Directory containing result XML files. These should be in jUnit format. See the description of the action.'
    required: true

    # The test results file output by gotestsum is missing file and line number on the XML elements
    # which is needed for the annotations to work. This script adds the missing information.

      # Always is REQUIRED here. Otherwise, the action will be skipped when the unit tests fail, which
      # defeats the purpose. YES it is counterintuitive. This applies to all of the actions in this file.
