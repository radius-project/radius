name: "Process Test Results"
description: |
  Processes a batch of test results including creating a github artifact and annotating the Pull Request (if applicable).

  This requires using 'gotestum' to run tests, which our makefile can do automatically. Install 'gotestsum' using:

    go install gotest.tools/gotestsum@v1.10.0

  You will also need to set the path for the results file using an environment variable. This would output the jUnit
  test results format which is what we require.

    GOTESTSUM_OPTS: '--junitfile ./dist/unit_test_results_raw.xml'

  Then running 'make <test target>' will do the right thing :)

  test_group_name:
    description: "Name to use for reporting (eg: Unit Tests)"

  artifact_name:
    description: "Name to use for uploading artifacts (eg: unit_test_results)"

    description: "Directory containing result XML files. These should be in jUnit format. See the description of the action."
