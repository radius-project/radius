# Radius

Radius is a developer-centric cloud-native application platform.

The core of Radius is using the declarative **application model** to describe complete applications that can be managed and deployed with an intelligent control plane. Radius uses the [Bicep](https://github.com/azure/bicep) language as a file-format and infrastructure-as-code tool.

## Contents

Radius consists of:

- Extensions to the Bicep language
- Application model that represents developer concepts with a declarative model
- Schemas for different compute and non-compute resource types
- CLI tools for deployment and management
- Multiple runtimes for application hosting
  - *For now* this is just Kubernetes
