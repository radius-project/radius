# Radius

Radius is a platform for developers and IT operators building cloud-native applications. With Radius, teams can model, deploy, manage, and troubleshoot entire applications across on-premises and multi-cloud environments, with a consistent set of tools and a common experience across it all.

## Overview

Application teams today struggle to build, deploy, and scale cloud-native applications. Not only do developers and IT operators need to model and manage complex app architectures, but they need to do so while balancing portability, organizational best-practices, regulatory requirements, and complex platform requirements. Even after figuring out all this and an app is deployed, teams struggle to communicate, visualize, and troubleshoot their app, often dealing with flat lists of resources that span every layer of the stack. 

As the pace of innovation increases for cloud-native technologies, so does the need for rapid progress within application teams. Application teams need a platform that can let developers and operators work together, while still maintaining the agility their users and applications require. These are the challenges that Radius is designed to solve.
