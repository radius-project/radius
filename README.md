# Radius

Radius is a cloud-native application platform that enables developers and the platform engineers that support them to collaborate on delivering and managing cloud-native applications that follow organizational best practices for cost, operations and security, by default. Radius is an open-source project that supports deploying applications across private cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services, with more cloud providers to come.

## Overview

The evolution of cloud computing has accelerated innovation for many companies, whether they are developing 2 or 3-tier applications or complex microservice-based applications. Cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes have made it easier to build applications that can run anywhere. However, as applications have grown in complexity, managing them in the cloud has become increasingly challenging. Companies now build cloud-native applications composed of interconnected services and deploy them to multiple public clouds and private infrastructure. While Kubernetes is a key enabler, organizations often need to create abstractions over Kubernetes to address its limitations. These abstractions usually focus on compute and aim to resolve Kubernetes' challenges, such as its lack of a formal application definition, mixing of infrastructure and application concepts, and overwhelming complexity. Developers also realize that their applications need more than just Kubernetes; they require support for dependencies like API front ends, key/value stores, caches, and observability systems. Amidst these challenges, corporate IT must enforce corporate standards, compliance, and security requirements while facilitating rapid application innovation.

Radius was designed to address these distinct but related challenges that arise across development and operations as companies continue their journey to cloud.  Radius meets application teams where they are by supporting proven technologies like Kubernetes, existing infrastructure tools including Terraform and Bicep and by integrating with existing CI/CD systems like GitHub Actions. Radius supports multi-tier web-plus-data to complex microservice applications like eShop, a popular cloud reference application from Microsoft.

**Key Features of the Radius Platform**

- *Team Collaboration*: Radius Applications and Environments enable developers to work with Operations on application definition and delivery.
- *Infrastructure Recipes*: Swappable infrastructure that complies with organization best practices and IT policy be default.
- *Application Graph*: Gain insights into the interconnections between services and infrastructure elements within an application.
- *Cloud Neutrality*: Deploy across development, on-premises and cloud environments with a consistent experience.
- *Incremental Adoption*: Seamlessly integrate Radius into existing workflows and Infrastructure-as-Code templates.
