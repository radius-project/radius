      The Radius.Compute/containers Resource Type is the primary resource type for running one or more containers. It is always part of a Radius Application. To deploy a Container add a resource to the application definition Bicep file.

      extension radius
      param environment string 

      resource myApplication 'Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview' = { ... }

      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            demo: {
              image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
            }
          }
        }
      }

      By default, Containers deploys to Kubernetes. In this case, a Kubernetes Deployment named myContainer is deployed which includes a Pod named myContainer. Your Radius environment may deploy to other container platforms such as Azure Container Instances. 

      To accept network connections, expose a port on the container.

      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            demo: {
              image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
              ports: {
                web: {
                  containerPort: 3000
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      
      When a port is included, a Kubernetes Service named demo with the type ClusterIP is created.
      
      To create a emphemeral emptyDir shared between two containers add a Containers.properties.volumes.

      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            frontend: {
              image: 'frontend:latest'
              volumeMounts: [
                {
                  volumeName: 'shared'
                  mountPath: '/var/shared' 
                }
              ]
            }
            backend: {
              image: 'backend:latest'
              volumeMounts: [
                {
                  volumeName: 'shared'
                  mountPath: '/var/shared' 
                }
              ]
            }
          }
          volumes: {
            shared: {
              emptyDir: {}
            }
          }
        }
      }

      The Radius.Compute/routes Resource Type defines network routes for responding to external clients. Note that a Routes resource is not required for service-to-service communication. To use Routes, define a Container and ensure a `containerPort` is specified.

      extension radius
      param environment string

      resource myApplication 'Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview' = { ... }
      
      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {

        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            frontend: {
              image: 'frontend:1.25'
              ports: {
                web: {
                  containerPort: 8080

            }
          }
        }
      }

      Then define a Routes resource.

      resource ingressRule 'Radius.Compute/routes@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'ingressRule'
        properties: {

                  httpPath: '/'
                }

              destinationContainer: {
                resourceId: myContainer.id

              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }

      The hostname is determined by the Recipe. 

      Multiple rules can be included in Routes.

  persistentVolumes:
    description: |
      The Radius.Compute/persistentVolumes Resource Type represents a persistent storage volume. A PersistentVolume can be referenced in the volumes property of a Container. 
      To deploy, first add a PersistentVolume resource to the application definition Bicep file.
      
      extension radius
      param environment string 

      resource myApplication 'Radius.Core/applications@2025-08-01-preview' = { ... }

      resource myPersistentVolume 'Radius.Compute/persistentVolumes@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myPersistentVolume'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          sizeInGib: 1
        }
      }

      Then reference the PersistentVolume by ID in the volumes property of the Container. Finally, set the mountPath in the container referencing the volumeName.

      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            demo: {
              image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
              volumeMounts: [
                {
                volumeName: 'data'
                mountPath: '/app/data'
                } 
              ] 
            }
          }
          volumes: {
            data: {
              persistentVolume: {
                resourceId: myPersistentVolume.id
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      
      PersistentVolumes may be shared across multiple Containers. To mount an existing PersistentVolume in read-only mode, reference the PersistentVolume by name using the `existing` Bicep keyword. For example:
      
      resource existingPersistentVolume 'Radius.Compute/persistentVolumes@2025-08-01-preview' existing = {
        name: 'existingPersistentVolume'
      }
      
      Then add the existing PersistentVolume to the volumes property of a Container with accessMode set to `ReadOnlyMany`.
      
      resource myContainer 'Radius.Compute/containers@2025-08-01-preview' = {
        name: 'myContainer'
        properties: {
          environment: environment
          application: myApplication.id
          containers: {
            demo: {
              image: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/samples/demo:latest'
              volumeMounts: [
                {
                  volumeName: 'readOnlyData'
                  mountPath: '/app/data' 
                }
              ]
            }
          }
          volumes: {
            readOnlyData: {
              persistentVolume: {
                resourceId: existingPersistentVolume.id
                accessMode: 'ReadOnlyMany'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      
      A PersistentVolume may be shared between multiple Containers in read/write mode if the PersistentVolume was created with `accessMode: ReadWriteMany` and the volume is set to ReadWriteMany as well. Note that not all infrastructures support this mode.
