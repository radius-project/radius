## Introduction

The Radius helm chart deploys the Radius services on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled
- Helm 3

### Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `radius`:

```console
helm upgrade --wait --install radius deploy/Chart -n radius-system
```

### Verify the installation

Verify that the controller is running in the radius-system namespace:

```
kubectl get pods -n radius-system
```

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `radius` deployment:

```console
helm delete radius
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

Uninstalling the chart will not delete any data stored by Radius. To clean up any remaining data, delete the radius-system namespace.
