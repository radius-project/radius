// About LocalIDs
//
// The LocalID concept exists to give each 'output resource' a *logical* name that is a unique and stable per-Radius-resource.
// This means that given the same inputs to a renderer, the outputs will contain the same set of LocalIDs. The LocalIDs are
// *not* randomly generated, they must be stable and predictable given the same input.
//
// Physical names (think resource ID) *must* be decoupled from our business logic, because they almost always have to be generated
// with a non-idempotent process due to uniqueness requirements. Consider the physical name of a resource to be a side-effect of creating
// it.
//
// Since we can't use physical names, LocalIDs exist to give us an identifier we *can* use.
//
// This is needed for a few reasons:
//
// This allows renderers to refer to and create dependencies between resources without *knowing* the physical names of those resources.
// The capability to refer to logical names is critical when multiple resources have a contract with each other (eg. a KeyVault)
// creates a KeyVault resource, and the container needs a role assignment to access it.)
//
// This allows diffing of expected state vs actual state. We can tell when a physical resource has disappeared. We can tell when a logical
// resource *should* disappear. This allows the renders a degree of control when the user-provided definition of a Radius resource changes.

// Represents local IDs used for output resources
