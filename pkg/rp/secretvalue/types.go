//
// This is surprisingly common. For example, it's common for access control/connection strings to apply
// to an 'account' primitive such as a ServiceBus namespace or CosmosDB account. The actual connection
// string that application code consumes will include a database name or queue name, etc. Or the different
// libraries involved might support different connection string formats, and the user has to choose on.
