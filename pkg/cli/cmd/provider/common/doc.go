Radius cloud provider integrations enable Radius to deploy cloud resources using Bicep, and for Radius
environments and connectors to integrate with those cloud resources. Radius also stores credentials for
use when accessing cloud resources.

Cloud providers are configured per-Radius-installation. Configuration commands will use the current workspace
or the workspace specified by '--workspace' to configure Radius. Modifications to cloud provider configuration
or credentials will affect all Radius environments and applications of the affected installation.`
