const LongDescriptionBlurb = `

Radius cloud providers enable Radius environments to deploy and integrate with cloud resources (Azure, AWS).
The Radius control-plane stores credentials for use when accessing cloud resources.

Cloud providers are configured per-Radius-installation. Configuration commands will use the current workspace
or the workspace specified by '--workspace' to configure Radius. Modifications to cloud provider configuration
or credentials will affect all Radius environments and applications of the affected installation.`
