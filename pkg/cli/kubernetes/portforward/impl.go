//	This function is responsible for running an application watcher. It first creates a typed client and REST config if they
//	 are not provided. Then it finds the relevant deployments for the application and excludes any replicasets that are 
//	outdated. Finally, it watches the deployments in the application and tries to forward to one pod. If the pod shuts down,
//	 it will pick the newest other replica and forward to that.

	// Up Front:
	// - Find the deployments that are relevant for the application
	// - Exclude any replicasets that are "old" - this command is frequently
	//   used right after a Radius deployment, so we want to ignore pods from the old
	//   replica set that are outdated.
	//
	// Then:
	// - Watch deployments in the application
	//   - For each deployment watch one pod and try to forward to it
	//     - If the pod shuts down then pick the newest other replice and forward to that
	watcher := NewApplicationWatcher(options)
