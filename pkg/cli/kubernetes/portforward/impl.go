	// - Exclude any replicasets that are "old" - this command is frequently
	//   used right after a Radius deployment, so we want to ignore pods from the old
	//   replica set that are outdated.
	//
	// Then:
	// - Watch deployments in the application
	//   - For each deployment watch one pod and try to forward to it
	//     - If the pod shuts down then pick the newest other replice and forward to that
