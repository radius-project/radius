package schema

/*
Package schema contains the validation logic based on the JSON
schema of the types defined in Radius Resource Provider's OpenAPI
spec.

We also use the JSON Schema files in this package to generate our
OpenAPI spec.

The JSON schema version used is Draft 4, and the OpenAPI version used
is 2.0.  There are incompatiblities between the two specifications,
therefore we will want to constraint our object schema to be within
the intersection of the two specs.

The main types are `Validator` and `ValidationError`. All surfaced
validation errors are of the type ValidationError. We strive to avoid
using the error types from our dependency to make it easier to swap
out the JSON validation library in the future if we want to.
