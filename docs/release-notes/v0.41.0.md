## Announcing Radius v0.41.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.41.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Improved UI for `rad init` CLI prompt in a small terminal window
We have resolved a usability issue where the text in the `rad init` CLI user interface gets cropped out of the visible area in a small terminal window. The text display area for the `rad init` UI now gets dynamically changed based on the terminal window dimensions, allowing for the text to be displayed instead of being cropped out of the visible display area.

## Breaking changes

None

## New contributors

Welcome to our new contributors who have merged their first PR in this release!

## Upgrading to Radius v0.41.0

1. Delete any environments you have created:
   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```
2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```
3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:
