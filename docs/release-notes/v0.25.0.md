## Announcing Radius v0.25.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.25.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.dev](https://radapp.dev), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Terraform Recipes

[Recipes](https://docs.radapp.dev/guides/recipes/overview/) now support Terraform. You can now add a Terraform module to your environment as a Recipe and deploy it with any Recipe-enabled resource. This allows your developers to self-service deploy and manage infrastructure while ensuring security and cost best practices are followed.

### Updated types for portable resources

[Radius portable resources](https://docs.radapp.dev/guides/author-apps/portable-resources/overview/) (_formerly Links_) now have a new look and feel. A new set of namespaces and types are available for you to use in your apps today, including Applications.Datastores, Applications.Messaging, and Applications.Dapr.

### New Kubernetes interoperability features

You can now customize a [Radius container](https://docs.radapp.dev/guides/author-apps/containers/overview/) with Kubernetes properties, or use a Kubernetes YAML file as its base. This allows you to migrate to Radius and/or punch through directly to the Kubernetes pod for when you need to access Kubernetes-specific properties from the Radius container abstraction.

### Renamed GitHub organization

The Radius GitHub organization has been renamed to `radius-project`. This aligns us with our new launch-name: "Radius".

## Breaking changes

- Previous bookmarks to https://github.com/project-radius will need to be updated to https://github.com/radius-project. We've re-registered the project-radius org to prevent redirect squatting so redirects should work in most cases, but make sure to use the new name when possible.
- All `Applications.Link` resources need to be moved to the new set of portable resource types (see above)


## Upgrading to Radius v0.25.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.25.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:
   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```
1. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```
1. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
1. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
