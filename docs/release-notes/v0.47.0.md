# Announcing Radius v0.47.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.47.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### `rad version` command now also displays control plane version
The `rad version` command in the Radius CLI has been updated to display both the CLI version on your machine and the control plane version running in your cluster. This change aims to provide clearer information for users to keep track of versions of the different Radius tools they have installed.
### Gateway Route timeouts configuration
A `timeoutPolicy` object has been added to the `routes` property in the Gateway resource, allowing users to configure custom timeout settings for their Gateway routes. This change offers improved control over request handling to enhance application performance, e.g. adding flexibility for accommodating long-running HTTP calls. For more details, please see the updated [Gateway resource reference](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/resource-schema/core-schema/gateway/#routes).
### Deploy Radius applications to Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Support for deploying applications to Azure Container Instances (ACI) is now available. You can now use Radius to provision an ACI compute environment then, without needing to modify your app definition, deploy applications and containers to the ACI environment. Radius provisions on your behalf all the necessary Azure infrastructure required to run your application. To try this feature, check out the [ACI how-to guide](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/author-apps/azure/azure-container-instances/).

## Breaking changes

None.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.47.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.47.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes

   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below

4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
