## Announcing Radius v0.53.0
Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.53.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Contour ingress controller installation re-enabled
Thanks to the newly available [Contour Helm Charts](https://github.com/projectcontour/helm-charts/releases/tag/contour-0.1.0), Radius has re-enabled installation of the Contour ingress controller during `rad install kubernetes` or `rad init`. This means that you no longer need to manually install and configure a Contour ingress controller before deploying Gateway resources.

### Improved Environment deletion experience
The [`rad env delete`](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_environment_delete/) command has been enhanced to make Environment cleanup safer and more transparent. It will now show different prompts for deleting empty vs. populated Environments to help users understand what will be deleted. Furthermore, progress messages during deletion operations have been added to provide clearer progress information during the deletion process.
