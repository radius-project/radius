## Announcing Radius v0.24.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.24.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.dev](https://radapp.dev), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Radius assets now published to GitHub Releases/Artifacts

Radius release assets are now published via [GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) and [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry). Stay tuned as we gradually move our installation scripts and delivery pipelines to these assets.

### `rad init` experience

`rad init` has been updated to initialize a developer-focused environment by default, complete with `local-dev` Recipes. The previous `rad init --dev` experience can now be run with just `rad init`. For a full list of prompts and customization options, run `rad init --full`. [Learn more](https://docs.radapp.dev/reference/cli/rad_init/)

### `rad app connections`

`rad app connections` is a new CLI command to visualize your application graph. Try it out to see the connections between your resources and the relationships they form. [Learn more](https://docs.radapp.dev/reference/cli/rad_application_connections/)

## Breaking changes

### `rad init`

To initialize a Radius installation with all available options, please use the `rad init --full` CLI command. This replaces the previous `rad init` experience. The simplified experience (formerly `rad init --dev`) is now `rad init`.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.24.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.24.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:
   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```
1. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```
1. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
