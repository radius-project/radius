## Announcing Radius v0.35.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.35.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Radius Azure Cloud provider supports Azure Workload Identity
You can now configure your Azure cloud provider to use Azure workload identity to deploy and manage Azure resources. With this support, infrastructure operators are not burdened with the rotation of the credentials anymore. More information on [how to configure the Workload identity](http://docs.radapp.io/operations/providers/azure-provider/howto-azure-provider-wi/)

### Nested modules in Terraform Recipes
With this release, Radius now supports authentication into private repositories for pulling Terraform Recipes that contain nested modules. See the [private Terraform modules guide](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/recipes/terraform/howto-private-registry/) for more details.

### EnableWebsockets property added to the Gateway Route Resource
The `EnableWebsockets` property has been added to the Gateway Route Resource so that it can be set by Radius users to enable features that make use of websockets, such as SignalR. See the [Gateway resource schema](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/resource-schema/core-schema/gateway/#routes) for more details.

## Breaking changes

Azure workload identity introduces some breaking changes to `rad credential register azure` CLI command. With the additional identity support, `rad credential register azure ` is now `rad credential register azure sp` to register the Service Principal identity and `rad credential register azure wi` to register the Azure Workload Identity.
