## Highlights

- **local-dev Recipes now available for most Links**: Local-dev Recipes come pre-installed with new Radius environments to make local development with Recipes a seamless experience. This release adds even more Links to the list of local-dev Recipes. [Check out the docs](https://docs.radapp.dev/author-apps/recipes/) to learn more.
- **Improved AWS experience for rad CLI**: Working with AWS just for even easier. The rad CLI can now enumerate and let you select AWS regions instead of manually entering region names.
