We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

## Highlights

None.

## Breaking changes

### `rad resource` commands

Support for User-defined resource types has introduced some breaking changes to `rad resource` commands. `rad resource` commands now require a fully qualified name along with namespaces to identify a resource, e.g. `rad resource expose containers` will now be `rad resource expose applications.core/containers` and `rad resource show containers` will now be `rad resource show applications.core/containers`. Learn more [here](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_resource/). Note that the support for end-end functionality for user-defined-resource-types is still in development and will be available in a future release.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.44.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.44.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
