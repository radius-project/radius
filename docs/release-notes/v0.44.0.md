We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

<!-- TALK TO THE PM TEAM ABOUT WHAT HIGHLIGHTS TO ADD HERE -->

## Breaking changes

<!-- ADD ANY BREAKING CHANGES HERE, IF ANY -->
### `rad resource` commands
Support for User-defined resource types has introduced some breaking changes to `rad resource` commands. `rad resource` commands now require a fully qualified name along with namespaces to identify a resource, e.g. `rad resource expose containers` will now be `rad resource expose applications.core/containers` and `rad resource show containers` will now be `rad resource show applications.core/containers`. Learn more [here](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_resource/). Note that the support for end-end functionality for user-defined-resource-types is still in development and will be available in a future release.

## New contributors

## Upgrading to Radius v0.44.0

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
