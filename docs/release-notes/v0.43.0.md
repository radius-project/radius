We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### DeploymentTemplate Controller
A new Kubernetes controller in Radius called the DeploymentTemplate Controller is now available that will allow users to deploy resources defined in Bicep manifests using Kubernetes tooling using Radius. This controller was added to enable integrations with GitOps platforms like Flux, which will be available in a future release. Please see the [DeploymentTemplate Controller design document](https://github.com/radius-project/design-notes/blob/main/architecture/2024-10-deploymenttemplate-controller.md) for more details.

   ```
