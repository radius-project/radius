## Announcing Radius v0.43.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.43.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### DeploymentTemplate Controller
A new Kubernetes controller in Radius called the DeploymentTemplate Controller is now available that will allow users to deploy resources defined in Bicep manifests using Kubernetes tooling using Radius. This controller was added to enable integrations with GitOps platforms like Flux, which will be available in a future release. Please see the [DeploymentTemplate Controller design document](https://github.com/radius-project/design-notes/blob/main/architecture/2024-10-deploymenttemplate-controller.md) for more details.
### Preparations for using PostgreSQL as the Radius database
In the near future, the Radius data store will be migrated from etcd to a PostgreSQL database. In preparation for this, the Helm chart for installing Radius now includes deploying PostgreSQL to the Kubernetes cluster. There are no changes to Radius when installed via `rad init`.
You can follow the progress of moving the Radius data store [in this issue](https://github.com/radius-project/radius/issues/8398).
## rad CLI command for creating new resource types
We have added a CLI command `rad resource-type create` to create new resource-types in Radius. This was added to enable resource extensibility in Radius. The end-end functionality of creating and deploying a user-defined resource type will be available in a future release. Learn more from the [UDT technical design document](https://github.com/radius-project/design-notes/blob/main/architecture/2024-07-user-defined-types.md)

## Upgrading to Radius v0.43.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.43.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:
   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```
2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```
3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
