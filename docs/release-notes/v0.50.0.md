# Announcing Radius v0.50.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.50.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Introducing in-place upgrades

Radius can now be upgraded using the new `rad upgrade` command. The new command upgrades the Radius control plane while preserving existing environments and applications. There is also a `rad rollback` command. Read more in the [Radius documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/kubernetes/kubernetes-upgrade/).

### Enhancements to Radius resource types

Properties on Radius resource types can now be arrays of objects. You can also now specify an `enum` type to validate inputs prior to deployment. 

The YAML file schema for resource type definitions changed. `name` is now `namespace`. For example, when you use `rad resource-type create -f types.yaml` to create a new resource type, the types.yaml file must have `namespace: Radius.Resources` rather than `name: Radius.Resources` on line one.

### Offline installation

Radius can now be installed in an offline environment using the `rad install` command or via the Helm chart by setting location of the Radius containers via the `global.imageRegistry` and `global.imageTag` parameters. 

## Breaking changes

The `name` property in resource type definition YAML file is now `namespace`. See the Radius resource type section above for details.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.50.0

You can upgrade to this release by upgrading your Radius CLI then running `rad upgrade kubernetes`. Only incremental version upgrades are supported. Consult the [upgrade documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/kubernetes/kubernetes-upgrade/) for full details.
