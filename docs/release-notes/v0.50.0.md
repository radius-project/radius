# Announcing Radius v0.50.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.50.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Introducing in-place upgrades

Radius can now be upgraded using the new `rad upgrade` command. The new command upgrades the Radius control plane while preserving existing environments and applications. There is also a `rad rollback` command. Read more in the [Radius documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/kubernetes/kubernetes-upgrade/).

### Enhancements to Radius resource types

Properties on Radius resource types can now be arrays of objects. You can also now specify an `enum` type to validate inputs prior to deployment. 

### Offline installation

Radius can now be installed in an offline environment using the `rad install` command or via the Helm chart by setting location of the Radius containers via the `global.imageRegistry` and `global.imageTag` parameters. 

## Breaking changes

No breaking changes in this release.
