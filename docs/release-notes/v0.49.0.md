## Announcing Radius v0.49.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.49.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Radius Resource Types (RRT) Enhancements

#### Radius Resource types Connection

Connection support between RRT->RRT is now available. For example, when connecting a Radius.Resources/webServices resource to a Radius.Resources/postgreSQL resource, the PostgreSQL properties are now included in the Recipe's context object. This makes it easier for platform engineers to reference these properties like creating secrets in Recipes.

#### `rad resource-type create`

The command [`rad resource-type create`](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_resource-type_create/) now supports creating all specified resource types in the `yaml` definition at once.

#### Multiple API versions 

RRTs now support multiple API versions. You can now version your custom resource types with the current date of your choice `2025-07-18-preview` following the required format `YYYY-MM-DD-preview`

#### Capabilities Improvements

- The capabilities: ["SupportsRecipes"] property is now deprecated and Recipe support is enabled by default. 

- Introduced capabilities: ["manualResourceProvisioning"] to support externally provisioned resources. This lets developers connect to resources outside of Radius, while platform engineers expose them via RRTs without needing Recipes.

### Contour Ingress Controller support

You now have full control over Contour during Kubernetes installation with `rad install kubernetes`:

- Use --contour-disabled to skip installing the Contour ingress controller.

- Use --contour-chart to install from a custom or local Helm chart. More information [here]https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_install_kubernetes/)

## Breaking changes

None

## Upgrading to Radius v0.49.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.49.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:
   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```
2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```
3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:
   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
