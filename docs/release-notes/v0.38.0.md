# Announcing Radius v0.38.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.38.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Secret stores in environment variables

Secret stores can now be referenced in the environment variables of a container resource. Previously, the only way to provide secrets to a container resource in Radius is to mount them through a secret volume, so the experience is now much simpler for users who only require the secrets to be passed into the container via environment variables. See the updated [container resource format](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/resource-schema/core-schema/container-schema/) for more information. Many thanks to community contributor @superbeeny for adding this functionality!

### Secret store reference in Dapr components

Support has been added to manage secrets in the Dapr components. This means that users may now reference non-Kubernetes secrets within the Dapr resources, closing a feature gap between Radius and Dapr. See the [How-To: Reference secrets in Dapr components](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/author-apps/dapr/how-to-dapr-secrets) guide for more information. Many thanks to community contributor @SoTrx for adding this functionality!

### Bicep private registry support

Support is now available for authentication into private registries for Bicep Recipes using basic auth (username/password), Azure workload identity, and AWS IRSA. See the how-to guide on [private Bicep registries](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/recipes/howto-private-bicep-registry/) to learn more.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.38.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.38.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below

4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
