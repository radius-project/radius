## Announcing Radius v0.52.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.52.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Usability improvements to `rad uninstall kubernetes`
The `rad uninstall kubernetes` command now lists all the resources that will be deleted, prompts the user for confirmation and performs a thorough cleanup of resources.  The`--purge` flag ensures that all Kubernetes resources created by Radius are deleted. For more details, see the [CLI documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_uninstall_kubernetes/).

### New environment type added
Introduced a new type `Radius.Core/environments`. This will be for future use.

### Helm chart updates for root CA support
Helm charts have been updated to support root CA configuration, improving security and deployment options.

### Usability improvements to `rad group delete`
The `rad group delete` command now displays a confirmation prompt listing all resources that will be deleted (if any) before deleting the group. For more details, see the [CLI documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_group_delete/)
