# Announcing Radius v0.46.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.46.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Removed dependencies on Dapr and PostgreSQL

In previous releases, dependencies on Dapr and PostgreSQL were added which meant that containers for both were instantiated alongside the Radius control plane at install time. These were added in preparation for the [external datastore](https://github.com/radius-project/roadmap/issues/49) features that have been in development. However, these dependencies have been found to break the Radius installation process in some scenarios. Thus, have decided to remove them from the Radius installation for now and will add them back in the future along with the features that depend on them.

## Breaking changes

None.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.46.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.46.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes

   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below

4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
