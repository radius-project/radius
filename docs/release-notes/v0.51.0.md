We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

## Highlights



## Breaking changes

### Contour ingress controller installation disabled

Radius no longer automatically installs the Contour ingress controller during `rad install kubernetes` or `rad init`. This change is due to Bitnami's deprecation of their public container registry, which affects the availability of Contour images. 

Applications that rely on Radius Gateway resources for ingress functionality will need to manually install and configure an ingress controller (such as Contour, NGINX, or others) before deploying Gateway resources.

This change is temporary while we evaluate alternative ingress controller options and repository sources.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.51.0

You can upgrade to this release by upgrading your Radius CLI then running `rad upgrade kubernetes`. Only incremental version upgrades are supported. Consult the [upgrade documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/kubernetes/kubernetes-upgrade/) for full details.
