# Announcing Radius v0.39.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.39.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Support for Dapr Configuration Building Block
A new `Applications.Dapr/configurationStores` resource type is now available to define and deploy the [Dapr Configuration](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/quickstarts/configuration-quickstart/) building block in Radius. The Dapr Configuration building block allows for dynamic configuration updates, including feature flag management, and is a great addition to the Dapr integration in Radius. To learn more, go to the [Dapr Configuration Store resource schema](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/resource-schema/dapr-schema/configurationstore/) in the Radius documentation. Thanks to community contributor @SoTrx for adding this functionality.

### In-memory data store for testing and development
Radius has added an implementation for an in-memory version of the data store interface, which may be used for testing and development purposes, when contributing to Radius. This helps to speed up and simplify the existing ETC.d and mocking mechanisms that are frequently used today in tests.

## Breaking changes
None.

## Upgrading to Radius v0.39.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.39.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below

4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
