# Announcing Radius v0.45.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.45.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Support for GitOps using Flux
Radius now has integrated first-class support for [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/), a popular GitOps tool. Flux is designed to work with Kubernetes and provides a set of features for managing applications and infrastructure through Git. To learn more, visit the [Radius and GitOps overview](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/deploy-apps/gitops/overview/) and [how-to guide for Radius + Flux](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/deploy-apps/gitops/howto-flux/).

## Breaking changes

None.
## Upgrading to Radius v0.45.0

During our preview stage, an upgrade to Radius v0.45.0 requires a full reinstallation of the Radius control-plane, rad CLI, and all Radius apps. Stay tuned for an in-place upgrade path in the future.

1. Delete any environments you have created:

   ```bash
   rad env delete <env-name>
   ```

2. Uninstall the previous version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad uninstall kubernetes
   ```

3. Visit the [Radius installation guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/install/) to install the latest CLI, or download a binary below
4. Install the latest version of the Radius control-plane:

   ```bash
   rad install kubernetes
   ```
