## Announcing Radius v0.22.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.22.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.dev](https://radapp.dev), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Recipe support for all Application.Link resources

All Applications.Link resources now support Recipes. This allows operators to add their approved Bicep templates to a Radius environment and developers to deploy any Radius Link without needing to define or configure any infrastructure. Learn more in the [docs](https://docs.radapp.dev/author-apps/recipes/).

## Breaking changes

- The Radius Helm chart has been updated, requiring a full uninstall and install of the Radius control-plane. `rad install kubernetes --reinstall` will not work. See [Upgrading to Radius v0.22.0](#upgrading-to-radius-v0220) for more details.
- The schema of all Applications.Link resources have been updated to the new format which defaults to Recipes. Applications with Links need to:
   - Update from `mode: 'values'` to `resourceProvisioning: 'manual'`
   - Update from `mode: 'resource'` to either Recipes or `resourceProvisioning: 'manual'`
- The schema of Radius Gateways has been updated to remove a duplicate 'hostname' field within the `tls` property. `tls.hostname` needs to be removed.

## New contributors
