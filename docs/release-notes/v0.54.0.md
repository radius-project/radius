# Announcing Radius v0.54.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.54.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Fixed `rad workspace show` errors when no current workspace exists

The `rad workspace show` command was updated to provide a more user-friendly experience when no workspace is currently set. Instead of returning an error, the command now logs an informational message to guide the user. See the [CLI docs](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_workspace_show/) for more details.

### Fixed `rad credential show azure` command

Previously, the `rad credential show azure` command would always throw an error due to a nil pointer dereference when attempting to display Azure Service Principal credentials. This has been fixed so that the command will now successfully display Azure credentials that you've configured for Radius.

## Breaking changes

None.
