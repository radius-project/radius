## Highlights

### Authentication for Any Terraform Provider
In a previous release, functionality was added that enables Radius to load and deploy the recipe modules consuming any [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). This functionality has now been extended to allow for the secure configuration and handling of credentials that allows for authenticating with the Terraform provider.
