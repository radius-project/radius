## Announcing Radius v0.34.0

Today we're happy to announce the release of Radius v0.34.0. Check out the [highlights](#highlights) below, along with the [full changelog](#full-changelog) for more details.

We would like to extend our thanks to all the [new](#new-contributors) and existing contributors who helped make this release possible!

## Intro to Radius

If you're new to Radius, check out our website, [radapp.io](https://radapp.io), for more information. Also visit our [getting started guide](https://docs.radapp.io/getting-started/) to learn how to install Radius and create your first app.

## Highlights

### Viewing the Application Graph using the CLI
Starting with this `v0.34` release, we have fully transitioned to the `rad app graph` command to view the Application Graph in the CLI. This means that the legacy command `rad app connections` will no longer be supported going forward. Learn more here: [CLI reference`rad app graph`](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_application_graph/)

### Testing infrastructure enhancements
The Radius team has been actively improving upon the testing coverage and infrastructure over the past couple of releases. We now have implemented a robust set of functional and long-running tests that are more reliable and cover the most recently released feature areas, including for private Terraform registries. Learn more about running the Radius test suite here: [Running Radius Tests](https://github.com/radius-project/radius/blob/main/docs/contributing/contributing-code/contributing-code-tests/README.md)

### User experience improvements with rad CLI 
- We have fixed the `rad init` user experience for app name with capital letters to include the error message from k8s as it does not allow capital letters in namespace names
- We have fixed the bug with `rad run` failing due to stern log collector limits. 

### Terraform recipes
We have fixed an issue with the Recipe deployment for Terraform providers that are not part of the official providers. Now Radius is enabled to load and deploy the recipe modules consuming any [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). Learn more about [Terraform Recipes in Radius](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/recipes/terraform/)
