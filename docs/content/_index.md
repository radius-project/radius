## Features

{{< cardpane >}}

{{< card title="**Model application behavior**" >}}
  Describe your apps by what they consume and provide, instead of what they run on.
  
  The Radius application model allows you to describe the bindings, dependencies, and traits your app provides. Developers no longer need to describe the infrastructure and connections that make up the underlying platform.

{{< card title="**Automate best practices**" >}}
  Easily initialize environments and deploy Radius applications.
  
  Radius codifies and automates the best practives for your hosting platform. We take care of things like connection strings, managed identities, role-based access control, and more.

{{< card title="**Easy application deployment & management**">}}
  Descriptive framework for cloud-native applications.
  
  Radius environments and the rad CLI make it easy to test applications locally and deploy to production from developer machines to CI/CD pipelines.

{{< card title="**Built-in Dapr support**" >}}
  Easily incorporate Dapr building blocks into your applications
  
  Radius allows you to easily add Dapr sidecars and components into your applications and deploy them across cloud and edge. Dapr makes your apps completely portable across cloud + edge.

{{< card header="**☁ Managed environments**" title="Descriptive framework for cloud-native applications" >}}
  A Radius environment is where you can deploy and host Radius applications.
  
  It includes a **control-plane** which communicates with with the rad CLI and a **runtime** to which applications are deployed.

{{< card header="**🔌 Extendable components**" title="Deploy your applications to cloud and edge with zero code changes" >}}
  Radius components let you model your compute and data and deploy across different Radius managed environments with no changes to your code.

  No more platform-specific pipelines and bindings to swap out and maintain.
