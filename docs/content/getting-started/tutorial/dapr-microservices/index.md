## Prerequisites

To begin this tutorial you should have already completed the following steps:

- [Install Radius CLI]({{< ref install-cli.md >}})
- [Create an environment]({{< ref create-environment.md >}})
- [(Recommended) Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

No prior knowledge of Radius is needed, this tutorial will walk you through authoring the deployment template and deploying a microservices application from first principles.

Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your editor for this tutorial is highly recommended. The [installation guide]({{< ref install-cli.md >}}) includes instructions for installing the Project Radius extension which provides syntax highlighting, completion, and linting.

You can also complete this tutorial with any basic text editor.

## Before you begin

This is a tutorial that will teach you how to use Radius to deploy a microservices application from first principles. As part of this tutorial you will learn the basic syntax of the Bicep language as well as the concepts of the Radius application model.

The application in this tutorial uses [Dapr](https://dapr.io). You do not need experience with Dapr to complete the tutorial.

## Understanding the application

The application you will be deploying is a microservices order processing application. There are three components:

- An order processing service written in Node.JS
- An order generating service written in Python
- A Dapr state store used to store the orders

You can find the source code for the application [here](https://github.com/dapr/quickstarts/tree/v1.0.0/hello-world) as well as additional information and tutorials for Dapr. You will not need to build the application from source or have Dapr installed to complete this tutorial.

Here is a diagram of the complete application:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/quickstarts/v1.0.0/hello-world/img/Architecture_Diagram_B.png" alt="The complete application" width=800>

### Order processing service

The order processing service (nodeapp) accepts HTTP requests to create or display orders. Here is a diagram focused on the order processing service:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dapr/quickstarts/v1.0.0/hello-world/img/Architecture_Diagram.png" alt="The nodeapp order processing service" width=700>

You can see that the nodeapp accepts HTTP requests on two endpoints: `GET /order` and `POST /neworder`.

The nodeapp also uses a [Dapr state store](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/state-management-overview/) to store information about orders.

### Order generating service

The order generting service (pythonapp) does not accept any incoming traffic, and uses [Dapr service invocation](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/service-invocation/service-invocation-overview/) to send requests to nodeapp. 

### Dapr state store
The state store could be any compatible Dapr state store. In this tutorial we will use Azure Table Storage.

## The Radius mindset

To get into the right mindset for Radius, you should think about the application in *logical* terms. The diagrams shown so far document the communication flows of the application, but there are some details that are missing. 

A Radius template includes all of the logical relationships of an application but also the operational details associated with those relationships. Here is an updated diagram that shows what the Radius template needs to capture:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1430011/111005089-04b3c280-833f-11eb-9ce1-bdd12beef78b.png" alt="The application logical diagram" width=800>

The diagram reflects important details of the Radius model that are different from other deployment technologies you may have used:

- The data components (statestore) are part of the application
- Relationships between components are fully specified with protocols and other strongly-typed information

In addition to this high level information, you will also need typical details like:

- container images
- listening ports
- programmatic identifiers and configuration like a Dapr app-id.

Keep the diagram in mind as you proceed through the following steps. Creating a Radius deployment template is similar to process of understanding a diagram like this one.

## Step 1: Creating the application definition

Radius uses the Bicep langauge as its file-format and structure. Create a new filed called `template.bicep` with the following content:

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

}
```

This defines the basic structure of an application. This declaration:

- Defines an application resource with the variable name of `app`. 
- Assigns the name `dapr-hello` to the application resource that will be created.

Declarations in Bicep start with `resource`. They also declare a variable, and assign a resource type, and then are followed by an equals-sign `=` and then an object. 

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Declarations" color="primary" %}}
Declarations in Bicep have symbolic (variable) names associated with them. The variable name `app` could be used in this file to reference the application in other declarations. The value of the `name` property (`dapr-hello`) is what will be used to identify the application during management operations.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Bicep Syntax" color="primary" %}}
Objects in Bicep don't need quotes around property names like in JSON. Properties in Bicep are separated by newlines, not commas. In general Bicep will require less typing than the equivalent JSON but they can express similar structures.

While Bicep uses newlines to separate properties and other syntax, it is not sensitive to indention like YAML is. By convention Bicep uses 2 spaces for indentation, but it is just a convention and not required.
{{% /alert %}}

At this point you could deploy the application but it doesn't contain any components and so it won't do anything interesting. In the next step, we will begin to fill in components.

## Step 2: Deploying a single container

Now that you've defined the shell for an application, you can add components to it.

### Add a component
We will first add a component representing a container.  
Inside your application definition, add the `nodeapp` component shown below.

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

  resource nodeapp 'Components' = {
    name: 'nodeapp'
    kind: 'radius.dev/Container@v1alpha1'
    properties: {
      run: {
        container: {
          image: 'radiusteam/tutorial-nodeapp'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The content you added declares a *component*. If you visualize the structure of an application *as a graph*, then *components* represent the nodes and things to deploy.

Components also include a *kind*. In this case the kind is `radius.dev/Container@v1alpha1` which represents a generic container.

A component can be:

- A resource that runs your code (eg. a container)
- A resource that works with data (eg. a message queue or database)
- A configuration resource (eg. configuration for an API gateway)

The *kind* specifies the kind of resource to create. The set of properties and settings available inside the body of the component depends on the kind. The `run` section is used to specify how the component runs. In this case `run` specifies a container image to run. 

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Naming" color="primary" %}}
Like the application declaration, components also declare a variable name. The variable name `nodeapp` could be used in this file to reference the component in other declarations. The value of the `name` property (also `nodeapp`) is what will be used to identify the component during management operations.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Run" color="primary" %}}
The `run` section is one of several top level sections in a *component*. In general components that run your code will have a `run` section.
{{% /alert %}}

### Add HTTP
You could deploy this now and it will run the `radiusteam/nodeapp` image, however you would have no way to interact with the running application.

You can add the ability to listen for HTTP traffic as depicted in the diagram above.

Expand your `nodeapp` as shown below so that it includes a web service definition via a `provides` section.

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

  resource nodeapp 'Components' = {
    name: 'nodeapp'
    kind: 'radius.dev/Container@v1alpha1'
    properties: {
      run: {
        container: {
          image: 'radiusteam/tutorial-nodeapp'
        }
      }
      provides: [
        {
          kind: 'http'
          name: 'web'
          containerPort: 3000
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

What you've added here defines a *service* called `web` and with the kind `http`. Services in Radius are logical connection-points. It's a way that one component can expose functionality for components of the application to bind to. In this case you've defined an HTTP service that others can use to find the URL of `nodeapp` and sent it HTTP traffic. There is nothing special about the name `web`, it is just an identifier used for the name of the service.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ HTTP services" color="primary" %}}
HTTP services in Radius are *internal*, meaning that they are not exposed to internet traffic by default.
{{% /alert %}}

### Deploy application

Now you are ready to deploy the application for the first time. 

First, double-check that you are logged-in to Azure. Switch to your commandline and run the following command:

```sh
az account show
```

If necessary, log into Azure via

```sh
az login
```

Then after that completes, run:

```sh
rad deploy template.bicep
```

This will deploy the application and launch the container.

To test it out, you can use the following command from the commandline:

```sh
rad expose dapr-hello nodeapp --port 3000
```

This will open a local tunnel on port 3000 to port 3000 inside the container. Then you can visit the URL `http://localhost:3000/order` in the browser. For now you should see a message like:

```txt
{"message":"The container is running, but Dapr has not been configured."}
```

If your message matches, then it means that the container is running. When you are done testing press CTRL+C to terminate the port-forward, and you are ready to move on to the next step.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ rad expose" color="primary" %}}
The `rad expose` command provides the application name, followed by the component name, followed by a port. If you changed any of these names when deploying, update your command to match.
{{% /alert %}}

## Step 3: Adding Dapr and the state store

As the message from the previous step stated, you haven't yet added Dapr. You also haven't configured the Azure Table Storage state store. This step will add both of these things.

### Add trait
We will first add a *trait* that describes the Dapr configuration. 
Expand your `nodeapp` as shown below so that it includes a `traits` section.

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

  resource nodeapp 'Components' = {
    name: 'nodeapp'
    kind: 'radius.dev/Container@v1alpha1'
    properties: {
      run: {
        container: {
          image: 'radiusteam/tutorial-nodeapp'
        }
      }
      provides: [
        {
          kind: 'http'
          name: 'web'
          containerPort: 3000
        }
      ]
      traits: [
        {
          kind: 'dapr.io/App@v1alpha1'
          properties: {
            appId: 'nodeapp'
            appPort: 3000
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `traits` section is used to configure cross-cutting behaviors of components. Since Dapr is not part of the standard definition of a container, it can be added via a trait. Traits have a `kind` so that they can be strongly typed. In this case we're providing some required Dapr configuration: the `app-id` and `app-port`.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Traits" color="primary" %}}
The `traits` section is one of several top level sections in a *component*. Traits are used to configure the component in a cross-cutting way. Other examples would include handling public traffic (ingress) or scaling.
{{% /alert %}}

### Add statestore component
Now the nodeapp is hooked up to Dapr, but we still need to address the topic of the state store.

Type the new component declaration from the following text inside your application definition. Leave your existing declaration for nodeapp unchanged.

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

  ...

  resource statestore 'Components' = {
    name: 'statestore'
    kind: 'dapr.io/StateStore@v1alpha1'
    properties: {
      config: {
        kind: 'state.azure.tablestorage'
        managed: true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This declaration adds the state store as a component of kind `dapr.io/StateStore@v1alpha1`. You've seen component declarations before, so you can notice some differences with this one. The `statestore` component has a "config" section, while the previous `noneapp` compnent had "run" and "provides" (services) sections.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Config" color="primary" %}}
The `config` section is one of several top level sections in a *component*. In general component that represent a data store will have a `config` section
{{% /alert %}}

Inside the `config` section you specified a `kind` of `state.azure.tablestorage`. This corresponds to the kind of Dapr state store used for [Azure Table Storage](https://docs.dapr.io/operations/components/setup-state-store/supported-state-stores/setup-azure-tablestorage/).

Inside the `config` section you specified `managed: true`. This flag tells Radius to manage the lifetime of the Azure Storage account for you. The Azure Storage account will be deleted when you delete the application.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Resource creation" color="primary" %}}
If you have used Dapr before, you may notice that you neither had to create the Azure Storage resource itself, nor configure Dapr with details like connection strings. Radius does this for you.
{{% /alert %}}

### Reference statestore from application
Now that you've created the state store as an component, you can reference it from nodeapp to connect them.

Type the additional content from the following text inside your application definition. What's new this time is the `dependsOn` section.

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

  resource nodeapp 'Components' = {
    name: 'nodeapp'
    kind: 'radius.dev/Container@v1alpha1'
    properties: {
      run: {
        container: {
          image: 'radiusteam/tutorial-nodeapp'
        }
      }
      dependsOn: [
        {
          kind: 'dapr.io/StateStore'
          name: 'statestore'
        }
      ]
      provides: [
        {
          kind: 'http'
          name: 'web'
          containerPort: 3000
        }
      ]
      traits: [
        {
          kind: 'dapr.io/App@v1alpha1'
          properties: {
            appId: 'nodeapp'
            appPort: 3000
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  ...
}
```

The `dependsOn` section is used to configure relationships between a component and services provided by other componentss. Since the `statestore` is of kind `dapr.io/StateStore@v1alpha1` it is considered to provide a service of kind `dapr.io/StateStore` implicitly. Configuring a dependency on a service is the other part of specifying a relation. This declares the *intention* from the `nodeapp` component to communicate with the `statestore` using `dapr.io/StateStore` as the protocol.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Relationships" color="primary" %}}
Radius captures the relationships and intentions behind an application so that they can simplify deployment. Examples of this include wiring up connection strings, or granting permissions, or restarting components when a dependency changes.
{{% /alert %}}

### Deploy application with Dapr

Now you are ready to deploy. Switch to the command-line and run the following command.

```sh
rad deploy template.bicep
```

This will deploy the application, including the Azure Storage account. This may take a few minutes because of the extra time required to create the Storage Account.

To test it out, you can use the following command from the commandline:

```sh
rad expose dapr-hello nodeapp 3000
```

This will open a local tunnel on port 3000. Then you can visit the URL `http://localhost:3000/order` in the browser. For now you should see a message like:

```txt
{"message":"no orders yet"}
```

If your message matches, then it means that the container is able to communicate with the state store. When you are done testing press CTRL+C to terminate the port-forward, and you are ready to move on to the next step.

## Step 4: Adding pythonapp

To complete the application, you need to add another component for the pythonapp.

### Add pythonapp component
Type the new component declaration from the following text inside your application definition. Leave your existing declarations for nodeapp and statestore unchanged.

```txt
resource app 'radius.dev/Applications@v1alpha1' = {
  name: 'dapr-hello'

  ...

  resource pythonapp 'Components' = {
    name: 'pythonapp'
    kind: 'radius.dev/Container@v1alpha1'
    properties: {
      run: {
        container: {
          image: 'radiusteam/tutorial-pythonapp'
        }
      }
      dependsOn: [
        {
          kind: 'dapr.io/Invoke'
          name: 'nodeapp'
        }
      ]
      traits: [
        {
          kind: 'dapr.io/App@v1alpha1'
          properties: {
            appId: 'pythonapp'
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The definition for pythonapp is simpler than what you have done so far for node app. There are few key points that you should notice:

- pythonapp doesn't listen for HTTP traffic, so it neither configures a Dapr app-port nor a service for HTTP
- pythonapp needs to communicate with nodeapp using the Dapr service invocation protocol

### Deploy application with pythonapp

Now you are ready to deploy. Switch to the command-line and run the following command.

```sh
rad deploy template.bicep
```

This will deploy the complete application, including both containers and the Azure Storage account.

To test it out, you can use the following command from the commandline:

```sh
rad expose dapr-hello nodeapp 3000
```

This will open a local tunnel on port 3000. Then you can visit the URL `http://localhost:3000/order` in the browser.

Refresh the page multiple times, and you should see a message like before, but the order number is steadily increasing.

```txt
{"orderId":28}
```

If your message matches, then it means that pythonapp is able to communicate with nodeapp. When you are done testing press CTRL+C to terminate the port-forward.

## Step 3: Cleanup

If you'd like to try another tutorial with your existing environment, go back to the [Radius tutorials]({{< ref tutorial >}}). 

If you're done with testing, clean up your environment to **prevent additional charges in your subscription**. 


Deleting an environment will delete:

- Your Radius environment
- The related resource group
- The application you just deployed

```sh
rad env delete azure --yes
```

You have completed this tutorial!
