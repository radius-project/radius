`Volume` provides an abstraction for an ephemeral or persistent volume to be referenced and mounted by a [ContainerComponent]({{< ref container >}}). Ephemeral volumes have lifecycles that are same as the container lifecycle, whereas persistent volumes have lifecycles that are separate from the container.
