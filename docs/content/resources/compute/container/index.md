`ContainerComponent` provides an abstraction for a container workload that can be run on any [Radius platform]({{< ref platforms >}}).

## Platform resources

Containers are hosted by the following runtimes on each platform:

| Platform | Resource |
|----------|----------|
| [Microsoft Azure]({{< ref azure>}}) | Kubernetes Deployment on AKS |
| [Kubernetes]({{< ref kubernetes >}}) | Kubernetes Deployment |

## Component format

{{< rad file="snippets/container.bicep" embed=true marker="//CONTAINER" >}}

The following top-level information is available for containers:

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| name | y | The name of your component. Used to provide status and visualize the component. | `frontend`

### Container

Details on what to run and how to run it are defined in the `container` property:

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| image | y | The registry and image to download and run in your container. | `radiusteam/frontend`
| env | n | The environment variables to be set for the container. | `"ENV_VAR": "value"`
| ports | n | Ports the container provides | [See below](#ports).
| readinessProbe | n | Readiness probe configuration. | [See below](#readiness-probe).
| livenessProbe | n | Liveness probe configuration. | [See below](#liveness-probe).

### Ports

The ports offered by the container are  defined in the `ports` section.

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| name | y | A name key for the port. | `http`
| containerPort | y | The port the container exposes | `80`
| protocol | n | The protocol the container exposes | `'TCP'`
| provides | n | The id of the [Route]({{< ref networking >}}) the container provides. | `http.id`

### Volumes

The volumes mounted to the container, either local or external, are defined in the `volumes` section.

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| name | y | A name key for the volume. | `tempstore`
| kind | y | The type of volume, either `ephemeral` or `persistent` (see below). | `ephemeral`

#### Ephemeral

Ephemeral volumes have the same lifecycle as the container, being deployed and deleted with the container. They create an empty directory on the host and mount it to the container.

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| mountPath | y | The container path to mount the volume to. | `\tmp\mystore`
| managedStore | y | The backing storage medium. Either `disk` or `memory`. | `memory`

#### Persistent

Persistent volumes have lifecycles that are separate from the container. ContainerComponents "attach" to another resource which contains the volume.

Persistent volumes are still in development, check back soon for updates on available volume providers.
{{% /alert %}}

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| mountPath | y | The container path to mount the volume to. | `\tmp\mystore`
| source | y | The resource if of the resource providing the volume. | `filestore.id`

### Readiness probe

Readiness probes detect when a container begins reporting it is ready to receive traffic, such as after loading a large configuration file that may take a couple seconds to process.
There are three types of probes available, `httpGet`, `tcp` and `exec`. For an `httpGet` probe, an HTTP GET request at the specified endpoint will be used to probe the application. If a success code is returned, the probe passes. If no code or an error code is returned, the probe fails, and the container won't receive any requests after a specified number of failures.
Any code greater than or equal to 200 and less than 400 indicates success. Any other code indicates failure.

For a `tcp` probe, the specified container port is probed to be listening. If not, the probe fails.

For an `exec` probe, a command is run within the container. A return code of 0 indicates a success and the probe succeeds. Any other return indicates a failure, and the container doesn't receive any requests after a specified number of failures.

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| kind | y | Type of readiness check, `httpGet` or `tcp` or `exec`. | `httpGet`
| containerPort | n | Used when kind is `httpGet` or `tcp`. The listening port number. | `8080`
| path | n | Used when kind is `httpGet`. The route to make the HTTP request on | `'/healthz'`
| command | n | Used when kind is `exec`. Command to execute to probe readiness | `'/healthz'`
| initialDelaySeconds | n | Initial delay in seconds before probing for readiness. | `10`
| failureThreshold | n | Threshold number of times the probe fails after which a failure would be reported. | `5`
| periodSeconds | n | Interval for the readiness probe in seconds. | `5`

### Liveness probe

Liveness probes detect when a container is in a broken state, restarting the container to return it to a healthy state.
There are three types of probes available, `httpGet`, `tcp` and `exec`. For an `httpGet` probe, an HTTP GET request at the specified endpoint will be used to probe the application. If a success code is returned, the probe passes. If no code or an error code is returned, the probe fails, and the container won't receive any requests after a specified number of failures.
Any code greater than or equal to 200 and less than 400 indicates success. Any other code indicates failure.

For a `tcp` probe, the specified container port is probed to be listening. If not, the probe fails.

For an `exec` probe, a command is run within the container. A return code of 0 indicates a success and the probe succeeds. Any other return indicates a failure, and the container doesn't receive any requests after a specified number of failures.

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| kind | y | Type of liveness check, `httpGet` or `tcp` or `exec`. | `httpGet`
| containerPort | n | Used when kind is `httpGet` or `tcp`. The listening port number. | `8080`
| path | n | Used when kind is `httpGet`. The route to make the HTTP request on | `'/healthz'`
| command | n | Used when kind is `exec`. Command to execute to probe liveness | `'/healthz'`
| initialDelaySeconds | n | Initial delay in seconds before probing for liveness. | `10`
| failureThreshold | n | Threshold number of times the probe fails after which a failure would be reported. | `5`
| periodSeconds | n | Interval for the liveness probe in seconds. | `5`

### Connections

Connections define how a container connects to [other resources]({{< ref resources >}}).

| Key  | Required | Description | Example |
|------|:--------:|-------------|---------|
| name | y | A name key for the port. | `inventory`
| kind | y | The type of resource you are connecting to. | `mongo.com/MongoDB`
| source | y | The id of the [Component]({{< ref components-model >}}) the container is connecting to. | `db.id`
