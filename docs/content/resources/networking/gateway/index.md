## Overview

`Gateway` defines how requests are routed to different resources, and also provides the ability to expose traffic to the internet. Conceptually, gateways allow you to have a single point of entry for  traffic in your application, whether it be internal or external traffic.

`Gateway` in Radius are split into two main pieces; the `Gateway` resource itself, which defines which port and protocol to listen on, and Route(s) which define the rules for routing traffic to different resources.

## Resource format

A Gateway is defined as a resource within your Application, defined at the same level as the resources providing and consuming the HTTP communication.
