Each node on the diagram maps to one **Component**. Components describe the code, data, and infrastructure pieces of an application. Components only have meaning within the context of an **Application**.

{{% alert title="üìÑ Radius Components" color="primary" %}}
The description of behavior and requirements for a single unit of software.
{{% /alert %}}

The Component is documentation for a piece of code, data, or infrastructure. It can capture all of the important behaviors and requirements needed for a runtime to host that software. An application can have both runnable components *(e.g. containers, web applications)* and non-runnable components *(e.g. databases, message queues)*.

## Component definition

When a Component describes your code, data, or infrastructure it needs to conceptually document the following details:

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Resource type** | What type of thing is this? | `ContainerComponent`
| **Name** | The logical name of the Component, must be unique per-Application and resource type | `my-container`
| **Essentials** | How do I run this? | Container image and tag (`my-container:latest`)
| **Connections** | What other Components will I interact with? | Need to read from `my-db` 
| **Routes** | What capabilities do I provide for others? | Offer an HTTP endpoint on `/home`
| **Traits** | What operational behaviors do I offer and interact with? | Need a Dapr sidecar (`dapr.io.App`)

These details can generally be separated into two categories:

- Details that are **always true** about the code *(eg. use `DBCONNECTION` to pass SQL Server connection string)*
- Details that are **per-deployment** *(eg. accept traffic with the hostname `myapp.example.com`)*

The Component concept in Radius is designed to version with the application code. For maximum flexibility, you should use Bicep parameters for the things that change per-deployment. This will allow you to provide these setting at the command line or by composing your definitions into other modules.

{{% alert title="üí° Key concept" color="info" %}}
Behaviors and requirements that are per-deployment, or otherwise separate from the code, can be made into parameters and configured separately from the Component definition.
{{% /alert %}} 

It's up to your discretion as the user to decide which details of your software are per-deployment and which are always true. Radius will also not stop you from writing *all-in-one* definitions that capture everything.

## Runnable Components

Runnable components capture the details of your code and its requirements. For example, a [ContainerComponent]({{< ref container >}}) describes your container and how to run it.

#### Bicep example

Within the shopping app example, each node is a Radius Component. Taking a look specifically at the storefront container, it would be modeled as:

{{< rad file="snippets/app.bicep" embed=true marker="//CONTAINER" >}}

### Runtime

Each [Radius platform]({{< ref platforms >}}) has a different implementation of a runtime for runnable Components such as a `ContainerComponent`. For example, Azure environments use Azure Kubernetes Service, while Kubernetes environments run containers directly on the cluster.

{{% alert title="üöß Under construction" color="info" %}}
As additional runnable Component types are designed and implemented, additional runtimes will be added to Azure environments. Stay tuned for more information.
{{% /alert %}}

## Non-runnable Components

When a Component defines a non-runnable unit of code: like a database or message queue, the same definitions apply, but generally more of the work is done for you. It's easier to describe a PostgreSQL database than it is to describe a container, because the database has many standard behaviors.

#### Bicep example

An example of a non-runnable Radius Component is an inventory database, modeled as:

{{< rad file="snippets/app.bicep" embed=true marker="//STATESTORE" >}}

### Resource lifecycle

Radius offers two methods for managing the lifecycle of a Component: Radius-managed and user-managed. Separately, you can use platform specific resources for any Bicep resources that do not have Radius Components that model them.

Radius-managed components are good for development purposes or to write an *all-in-one* deployable application. User-manged resources allow you to bind to infrastructure, such as cloud resources that are deployed separately from your code.

{{% alert title="üí° Key concept" color="info" %}}
User-managed resources allow you to represent cloud resources as part of your application and have an easier experience connecting to them. You can create user-managed resources using the same `.bicep` files as your application or create them separately.

#### User-managed

When `managed` is set to `false` or omitted, you can explicitly specify an existing `resource` which you manage. This allows you to connect your Radius Components to existing databases, queues, and other non-compute resources. When you delete your Application Radius will not change or delete your existing resource.

{{< rad file="snippets/database-usermanaged.bicep" embed=true replace-key-properties="//PROPERTIES" replace-value-properties="properties: {...}" >}}

#### Radius-managed

When `managed` is set to `true`, like in the example above, Radius will manage the lifecycle of the underlying resource, meaning it will deploy and manage the resource itself on the [hosting platform]({{< ref platforms >}}).

{{% alert title="üìã Feedback" color="primary" %}}
We'd love to hear your feedback on User-managed resources. Please visit [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Azure/radius/discussions/1269) and let us know how you currently use and want to use them!

### Portability

Non-runnable Components can work across hosting models without any configuration changes, and will be satisfied using the best means available by the host. They are generally OSS services that are not tied to any particular SaaS or hosting platform and usually have multiple implementations.

For example the resource type [`mongodb.com.MongoDBComponent`]({{< ref mongodb >}}) specifies a generic MongoDB-compatible database. From the point-of-view of application code, it does not matter if the database is hosted using Kubernetes primitives like a `StatefulSet`, or a MongoDB operator, or a cloud-provider hosted offering like Azure CosmosDB. Radius will provision (or connect to) the appropriate implementation depending on the environment where the application is deployed.

## Platform-specific resources

Some resources you use in your application don't have a Radius type to bind to. For example, Azure Cognitive Services offers a service that isn't portable across environments, having only a service in Azure.

These resources can still be used in Radius Applications. Instead of being modeled as a resources within an Application, they can be placed *beside* an Application, and other Components can still reference resource connection strings and other data.

Additionally, through the use of the [Bicep existing keyword](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/resource-declaration?#reference-existing-resources), you can connect to resources that are deployed and managed separately from the Application.

You can configure role based access control (RBAC) on Azure resources by specifying roles within the connection information. See [the connections page] {{< ref connections-model >}} for more details:
