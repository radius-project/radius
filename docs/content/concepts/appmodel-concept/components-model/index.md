Components describe the code, data, and infrastructure pieces of an application.   

Simplistically, each node of an architecture diagram would map to one Component. Together, an Application's Components capture all of the important behaviors and requirements needed for a runtime to host that app. 

## Component definition

In your app's Bicep file, the Component resource captures: 

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Resource type** | What type of thing is this? | `Container`
| **Name** | The logical name of the Component, must be unique per-Application and resource type | `my-container`
| **Essentials** | How do I run this? | Container image and tag (`my-container:latest`)
| **Connections** | What other Components will I interact with? | Need to read from `my-db` 
| **Routes** | What capabilities do I provide for others? | Offer an HTTP endpoint on `/home`
| **Traits** | What operational behaviors do I offer and interact with? | Need a Dapr sidecar (`dapr.io.App`)

## Example Radius Components


Runnable components capture the details of your code and its requirements. For example, a [Container]({{< ref container >}}) describes your container and how to run it.

#### Bicep example

In an example eshop app, the storefront code's would include info necessary for the storefront container to run:

{{< rad file="snippets/app.bicep" embed=true marker="//CONTAINER" >}}

<<<<<<< HEAD
When a Component defines a non-runnable resource (e.g. a database or message queue), the same definitions apply, but it's even easier to describe in Radius. Since behavior of non-runnable resources is more standardized, Radius can offload this type of repetitive configuration work from developers.
=======
### Runtime

Each [Radius platform]({{< ref platforms >}}) has a different implementation of a runtime for runnable Components such as a `Container`. For example, Azure environments use Azure Kubernetes Service, while Kubernetes environments run containers directly on the cluster.

An example of a non-runnable Radius Component is an inventory database, modeled as:

## Runtime

Since Radius Applications can be deployed to a variety of [Radius-supported platforms]({{< ref platforms >}}), some Components use a different runtime based on platform. For example, under-the-hood of `ContainerComponent`, Azure deployments use Azure Kubernetes Service while Kubernetes deployments run containers directly on the user's cluster.


### Resource lifecycle
<!-- TODO: overhaul this section as we replace Radius-managed with Bicep modules -->

Radius offers two methods for managing the lifecycle of a Component: Radius-managed and user-managed. Separately, you can use platform specific resources for any Bicep resources that do not have Radius Components that model them.

Radius-managed components are good for development purposes or to write an *all-in-one* deployable application. User-manged resources allow you to bind to infrastructure, such as cloud resources that are deployed separately from your code.

{{% alert title="üí° Key concept" color="info" %}}
User-managed resources allow you to represent cloud resources as part of your application and have an easier experience connecting to them. You can create user-managed resources using the same `.bicep` files as your application or create them separately.

#### User-managed

When `managed` is set to `false` or omitted, you can explicitly specify an existing `resource` which you manage. This allows you to connect your Radius Components to existing databases, queues, and other non-compute resources. When you delete your Application Radius will not change or delete your existing resource.

{{< rad file="snippets/database-usermanaged.bicep" embed=true replace-key-properties="//PROPERTIES" replace-value-properties="properties: {...}" >}}

#### Radius-managed

When `managed` is set to `true`, like in the example above, Radius will manage the lifecycle of the underlying resource, meaning it will deploy and manage the resource itself on the [hosting platform]({{< ref platforms >}}).

{{% alert title="üìã Feedback" color="primary" %}}
We'd love to hear your feedback on User-managed resources. Please visit [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/project-radius/radius/discussions/1269) and let us know how you currently use and want to use them!

## Parameterizing per-deployment Component details

Component details can generally be separated into two categories:

- Details that are **always true** about the code *(eg. use `DBCONNECTION` to pass SQL Server connection string)*
- Details that are **per-deployment** *(eg. accept traffic with the hostname `myapp.example.com`)*

The Component concept in Radius is designed to version with the application code. For maximum flexibility, you should use Bicep parameters for the things that change per-deployment. This will allow you to provide these setting at the command line or by composing your definitions into other modules.

<!-- TODO: add example here -->

### Portability

Non-runnable Components can work across hosting models without any configuration changes, and will be satisfied using the best means available by the host. They are generally OSS services that are not tied to any particular SaaS or hosting platform and usually have multiple implementations.

For example the resource type [`mongo.com.MongoDatabase`]({{< ref mongodb >}}) specifies a generic MongoDB-compatible database. From the point-of-view of application code, it does not matter if the database is hosted using Kubernetes primitives like a `StatefulSet`, or a MongoDB operator, or a cloud-provider hosted offering like Azure CosmosDB. Radius will provision (or connect to) the appropriate implementation depending on the environment where the application is deployed.

## Platform-specific resources

Some resources you use in your application don't have a Radius type to bind to. For example, Azure Cognitive Services offers a service that isn't portable across environments, having only a service in Azure.

These resources can still be used in Radius Applications. Instead of being modeled as a resources within an Application, they can be placed *beside* an Application, and other Components can still reference resource connection strings and other data.

Additionally, through the use of the [Bicep existing keyword](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/resource-declaration?#reference-existing-resources), you can connect to resources that are deployed and managed separately from the Application.

You can configure role based access control (RBAC) on Azure resources by specifying roles within the connection information. See [the connections page] {{< ref connections-model >}} for more details:

## Next step

Now that you are familiar with Radius Components, the next step is to learn about Radius Connections.

{{< button text="Learn about Connections" page="connections-model.md" >}}


An application can have both runnable components *(e.g. containers, web applications)* and non-runnable components *(e.g. databases, message queues)*.
