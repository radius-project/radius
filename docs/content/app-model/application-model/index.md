Radius applications are the largest circle you could draw around your software. It is the boundary within which names have meaning. The other concepts in Radius define symbolic names - the Application is the scope in which these names must be unique, and in which they are referenced.

Radius applications are meaningless without the [components]({{< ref components-model.md >}}) that make them up. Components are the software and resources that make up an application.

## Example

This example shows a blank application with nothing in it. Deploying this would do nothing as there are no [components]({{< ref components-model.md >}}).

Now that you are familiar with Radius applications, the next step is to learn about Radius components.
