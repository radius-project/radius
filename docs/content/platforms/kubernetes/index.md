## Kubernetes environments

A Kubernetes Radius environment consists of various resources that together allow a Radius application to run on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Managing environments

These steps will walk through how to deploy, manage, and delete environments in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Pre-requisites

- [rad CLI]({{< ref install-cli.md >}})
- A Kubernetes Cluster. There are many different options here, including:
  - [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster)
  - [Kubernetes in Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-windows-desktop-now-kubernetes/), however it does take up quite a bit of memory on your machine, so use with caution.
  - [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
  - [K3s](https://k3s.io), a lightweight single-binary certified Kubernetes distribution from Rancher.
  - Another Kubernetes provider of your choice.

If you choose a container registry provided by a cloud provider (other than Dockerhub), you will likely have to take some steps to configure your Kubernetes cluster to allow access. Follow the instructions provided by your cloud provider.

### Initialize an environment

1. Initialize a Radius environment interactively:

   ```bash
   rad env init kubernetes -i
   ```

   Follow the prompts, specifying the namespace which applications will be deployed into.

   {{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ About namespaces" color="success" %}}
   When Radius initializes a Kubernetes environment, it will deploy the system resources into the `radius-system` namespace. These aren't part your application. The namespace specified in interactive mode will be used for future deployments by default.

1. Verify initialization

   To verify the environment initialization succeeded, you can run the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployments -n radius-system
   ```

   The output should look like this:

   ```bash
   NAME                        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   radius-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           30s
   ```

### Delete an environment

Use the rad CLI to [delete an environment]({{< ref rad_env_delete.md >}}):

```bash
rad env delete -e <ENVIRONMENT_NAME> --yes
```

This will currently remove the entry for the kubernetes environment in your config file. It will *NOT* remove the resources created in the kubernetes cluster. In future updates, a better story around uninstalling/deletion will be provided.
