# 003 ADR: Shared Data Store for Radius RP and UCP

## Context

Right now, the Radius RP and UCP require a shared data store. This ADR documents the need for a shared data store between the Radius RP and UCP. This is subject to change in the future.

UCP owns the ResourceGroup resource and implements the CRUD operations on the ResourceGroup. All the Applications.Core/Applications.Link Resource Provider resources are contained within the resource group but are owned by the RP.

We need to enable querying of all resources within a resource group for supporting deletion of a resourceGroup. However, since the individual resources within the resource group are owned by the RP, the UCP has no knowledge of those unless we have a shared data store.

With a shared data store, UCP can make a query to the data store to return all resources starting with the prefix "/resourceGroups/<rg-name>" and retrieve a list of all resources under the resource group. UCP can then make individual delete requests on each resource which will be processed by the RP.
