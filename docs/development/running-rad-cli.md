# Running rad CLI

For a lot of your development tasks you will need to build `rad` from source instead of using a binary.

This is the best way to test changes, and to make sure you have the latest bits (other people's changes).

## Creating an wrapper script (MacOS/Linux)

Create the following script and place it on your path with a name like `dev-rad`. 

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu
go run ~/github.com/Azure/radius/cmd/cli/main.go $@
```

Replace `~/github.com/Azure/radius` with the path to your repository root.

Run `chmod +x dev-rad` to mark it executable

Now use it as-if it were `rad`

```txt
âžœ dev-rad env
