Our release process for Project Radius is based on git tags. Pushing a new tag with the format: `v.<major>.<minor>.<patch>` will trigger a release build.

{{% alert title="üöåüöåüöå Busfactor Warning üöåüöåüöå" color="warning" %}}
Currently performing a release involves our custom Bicep compiler - which is in a private fork. We'll update these instructions in the future when this moves to a shared repository.
{{% /alert %}}

## Pre-requisites

- Find the storage account on Azure under 'Radius Dev' subscription. It is called `radiuspublic`
- Determine the release version. This is in the form `v.<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- Determine the release channel This is in the form `<major>.<minor>`

## Performing a release

1. In the Bicep fork:

   ```bash
   # replace v0.1.0 with the release version
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push --tags
   ```

   Verify that GitHub actions triggers a build in response to the tag, and that the build completes.

   Next, check the timestamps in the `tools` container of the storage account. There should be new builds of `rad-bicep` and the VS Code extension that correspond to the channel. Look at the paths `tools/bicep/<channel>/<architecture>/` and `tools/vscode/<channel>`. These should reflect the new build.

   ```bash
   az storage blob directory list -c tools -d bicep --account-name radiuspublic --output table
   az storage blob directory list -c tools -d vscode --account-name radiuspublic --output table
   ```

2. In the azure/radius repo:

   ```bash
   # replace v0.1.0 with the release version
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push --tags
   ```

   Verify that GitHub actions triggers a build in response to the tag, and that the build completes.

   Next, check the timestamps in the `environment` container of the storage account. There should be new copies of our environment setup assets that correspond to the channel.  Look at the path `environment/<channel>/`. These should reflect the new build.

   ```bash
   az storage blob directory list -c environment -d <channel> --account-name radiuspublic --output table
   ```
3. Updating Helm chart

   Each release, we need to update the verison of the helm chart to the next version. 
   
   In the Chart.yaml file, based on whether we are releasing a major, minor, or patch version, increase the version number accordingly. When branching for a major or minor release, we need to increment the version in the 'main' branch, while for patch changes, we updating it in the release/X branch. 
   
   For example, if we are releasing 0.4, we change the main branch Chart.yaml version to 0.5.0. If we are releasing a patch on 0.4, we update the Chart.yaml version in the release/0.4 to 0.4.1 (or one higher than the current patch version).

   If this process fails for whatever reason, a manual upload works well as a backup. Run the following:
   ```bash
   cd deploy/Chart
   # Replace version: 0.X.0 with this release version in Chart.yaml
   # Replace tag: 0.X with this release version in values.yaml
   helm package .
   az acr helm push -n radius radius-0.9.0.tgz --force
   # To verify upload worked
   az acr helm list -n radius
   ```

4. Check the stable version marker

   If this is a patch release - you can stop here, you are done.
   
   If this is a new minor release - check the stable version marker.
   
   The file https://radiuspublic.blob.core.windows.net/version/stable.txt should contain (in plain text) the channel you just created.
   
   You can find this file in the storage account under `version/stable.txt`.

5. Update the docs
   
   1. Within GitHub delete the branch for the prior Radius release, *e.g. `release/0.1`*.
   1. Create a new branch named `release/X.Y` from `main`, using the release version number.
   1. Update the branch information for the docs. Example: https://github.com/project-radius/radius/commit/f4b81b8881d590fbf077280db6a05482ed44188b
   1. Within `docs/config.toml` update the `baseURL` parameter  to be `https://radapp.dev/` instead of `https://edge.radapp.dev/`.
   1. Within `.github/workflows/website.yml` update the branch to be the new `release\X.Y` branch you created above.
   1. Within `.github/workflows/website.yml` update `${{ secrets.EDGE_DOCS_SITE_PUBLISHPROFILE }}` to `${{ secrets.DOCS_SITE_PUBLISHPROFILE }}` and "edge-radius" to "radius".
   1. In `docs/content/getting-started/install-cli.md` update the binary download links with the new version number, and delete commands for unstable/version commands, including all sub-headers.
   1. Commit and push updates to be the new `release\vX.Y` branch you created above.
   1. Verify https://radapp.dev now shows the new version.

## How releases work

Each release belongs to a *channel* named like `<major>.<minor>`. Releases will only interact with assets from their channel. For example, the `0.1` `rad` CLI will:

- Download `rad-bicep` from the `0.1` channel
- Create an environment using the `0.1` version of the RP and environment setup script

{{% alert title="‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility ‚ö†Ô∏è" color="warning" %}}
At this time we do not guarantee compatibility across releases or provide a migration path. For example, the behavior of a `0.1` `rad` CLI talking to a `0.2` control plane is unspecifed. We expect the project to change too frequently to provide compatibility guarantees at this time.
{{% /alert %}}

Conceptually we scope channels to a major+minor pair because this allows us to freely patch assets as needed without needing to change the intermediate pieces. For example pushing a `v0.1.1` tag will update the assets in the `v0.1` channel. This works as long as it is a *true* patch release and maintains compatibility.
