# Troubleshooting a Radius installation

This page explains some troubleshooting steps that can help you diagnose installation failures or crashes using a custom build of Radius.

## Verify all Radius pods are up and running

```bash
kubectl get pods -n radius-system
```

The installation includes UCP, Applications RP, Dynamic RP, Controller, Deployment Engine, and the PostgreSQL database. The exact pod names contain generated suffixes. Every pod should become `Running` or complete successfully; use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n radius-system` for a pod that remains pending or repeatedly restarts.

## Examine logs

Read logs by deployment name instead of copying an ephemeral pod name:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/ucp -n radius-system
kubectl logs deployment/applications-rp -n radius-system
kubectl logs deployment/dynamic-rp -n radius-system
kubectl logs deployment/controller -n radius-system
kubectl logs deployment/bicep-de -n radius-system
```

For a specific pod or container, use:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

Logs with `severity` set to `error` or `warn` could point to why the pods are not in Running state.

Every `rad` CLI error includes a `traceId` that also appears in the control-plane logs. Search all Radius pod logs for that value:

```bash
kubectl logs -n radius-system -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=radius --all-containers=true --prefix | grep <traceId>
```

See the [observability documentation](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/operations/control-plane/logs/) for more logging guidance.

## The installation times out

`rad install kubernetes` waits for the control-plane resources to become ready and fails with an error like this if they do not:

```text
Error: failed to apply Radius Helm chart, err: failed to run Helm install, err: resource Deployment/radius-system/ucp not ready. status: InProgress, message: Available: 0/1
context deadline exceeded
```

The default budget is 10 minutes, which is ample for a typical install. A cold cluster has to pull every control-plane image before any deployment can become ready, so a slow or throttled network can exceed the default. Allow more time with `--timeout`:

```bash
rad install kubernetes --timeout 30m
```

`--timeout` accepts any Go duration (`30m`, `1h`). Negative values are rejected, and `0` means "use the default".

If the install still times out, check whether the pods are actually healthy using the steps above. Pods that are `Running` and `Ready` while the install reports a resource as `InProgress` point at the readiness watcher rather than your cluster — see [radius-project/radius#12975](https://github.com/radius-project/radius/issues/12975).
