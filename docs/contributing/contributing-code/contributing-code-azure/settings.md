The Radius Resource Provider supports a number of different settings that will configure its behavior. The primary purpose of the resource provider is support Azure integration, so by default the RP behaviors are optimized towards Azure.

Unlike the `rad` CLI or other infrastructure, all of the supported settings for the Radius RP are environment variables.

Many of the optional settings are booleans, which apply the following logic:

- `true` enables the setting. This value is compared *case-insensitively*, so `True` would also be accepted.
- ANY other value disables the setting. 

Enum values are compared *case-insensitively*.

## ARM authentication

Authentication with ARM can be disabled totally by setting `SKIP_ARM=true`. This will disable ARM features like creation and management of Azure resources.

The RP can connect to ARM using credentials from one of three different sources in order of priority:

- Service Principal
- Managed Identity (used when deployed)
- CLI authentication (used in local development)

Our detection logic mirrors what the newer Azure Go SDKs do. Since we require the use of the old-style SDKs we also perform the same logic. The environment variables we use to read these settings are the **standard set** used by all Azure tools. eg: `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is the standard environment variable supported by all Azure tools. 

## Kubernetes

Authentication with Kubernetes can be disabled totally by setting `SKIP_K8S=true`. This will disable Kubernetes features like creation and management of containers/pods and ingresses.

The RP can connect to Kubernetes using three different strategies to find the identity and credentials in order or priority:

- Using local Kubeconfig (used in local development)
- Using in-cluster credentials
- Using ARM to fetch credentials based on `K8S_CLUSTER_NAME`/`K8S_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`/`K8S_RESOURCE_GROUP` (used when deployed)

Our detection logic treats `K8S_LOCAL` and `K8S_CLUSTER` as overrides. We will attempt to find the cluster using ARM by default.

## Logging

Radius Resource Provider uses the zap logger as the log sink and logr as the interface.

### Configuring Radius Log Profile
Radius Log Profile can be set using the environment variable RADIUS_LOG_PROFILE. The allowed values are `production` and `development`. This setting controls the output log encoding format, default log level and other related zap logger settings.

### Configuring Radius Log Level
Radius Log Level can be set using the environment variable RADIUS_LOG_LEVEL. The allowed values are `normal` or `verbose`. If this environment variable is not set, the default log level is determined by the log profile configured above.
