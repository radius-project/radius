# Your first commit: Running tests

## Running tests

To run all the unit tests for the project from the command line:

```sh
make test
```

After tests run, you should see a big list of all of the project's packages:

The Go test tools do not make much fanfare when all the tests pass - it just says `ok` for every package that has tests.
In general it will be very obvious in the CLI output if something failed.

## Running/Debugging a single test

The best way to run a single test or group of tests is from VS Code.

Open `./pkg/rad/config_test.go` in the editor. Each test function has the options to run or debug the test right above it.
